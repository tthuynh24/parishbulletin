Adjusting Paper Size under Printer Properties Does Not Update the Application 
Jump to solution

Using the latest Xerox printer drivers, either the Phaser 7750GX / 7760GX specific drivers or the Xerox Global Print drivers, 
we are getting different behavior in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat Standard / Professional than we did with prior Windows XP drivers.  
The behavior is also different from the latest print drivers for all the other printers we use in use, 
both standalone printers and digital copiers.  Specifically, when you go to print a PDF document, select the Xerox printer, 
then click Properties, if you change the Paper Size (for example from Letter to Tabloid), then click OK, the Paper Size change is 
not fed back to the Adobe application.  All other printer drivers we use, including XP-version Xerox printer drivers, successfully 
feed back the Paper Size change.  Is there any way to do this with the latest Xerox printer drivers?  Thanks!

Re: Adjusting Paper Size under Printer Properties Does Not Update the Application 
I found the solution.  In the Xerox printer properties dialog box, click the Paper drop-down and select "Other Size..."  
Then in the "Original Document Size: drop-down box (4th drop-down box from the top), choose the desired paper size.  
Then click Close, OK, OK, and when you return to the PDF document it will show the dimensions of the new paper size chosen.
